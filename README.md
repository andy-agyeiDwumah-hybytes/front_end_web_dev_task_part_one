# Front-End Web Development (Part 1) üí•

This is **Part 1** of the Front-End Web Development task. This covers the following months:

* **Month 1**: HTML & CSS
* **Month 2**: Advanced CSS & Introduction to JavaScript
* **Month 3**: JavaScript DOM Manipulation & Events
* **Month 4**: jQuery & AJAX

**Note: For the sake of this task, environment variables are mimicked in `secretFile.js` rather**
**than using a backend solution (e.g., Node.js). In a real-world scenario, a backend would**
**be used to securely store and handle API keys.**

## Prerequisites‚ùó

Before starting, you will need to:
1. Create an account with [RapidAPI](https://rapidapi.com/) to get your APIKEY
2. Subscribe to the following APIs (free of cost):

* WordsAPI

This is necessary to view the following exercises:
1. Fetch Data from API
2. Weather Application
3. News Aggregator
4. Dynamic Search Feature

## Getting Started ‚úÖ

1. Clone the repository: <br>
`git clone https://github.com/andy-agyeiDwumah-hybytes/front_end_web_dev_task_part_one.git`

2. Create the `secretFile.js` file in the root directory of this project

3. Inside `secretFile.js`, add your API key. The file should look like:
```javascript
const APIKEY = "your-api-key-here;"
export default APIKEY;
```

Replace `your-api-key-here` with the APIKEY obtained from Rapid API.

4. Now, you can run the project as usual.
